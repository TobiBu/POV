This summer term we have completed an interesting internship at our university: We've constructed a persitence of vision globe. <br>
The internship started in June 2015 already and lasted until the October 2015.

The university
</h2>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
The internship took place at the <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/">University of Heidelberg</a>, located in a small, but famous and beautiful town in the south of Germany. The university can proudly call itself the oldest one in Germany.<br>
Altough all of us are studying physics, the project is part of the <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/">IWR (interdisciplinary research center for scientific computing)</a> at the <a href="http://www.mathinf.uni-heidelberg.de/">Informatics Faculty</a>, which illustrates the flexibility in our studies and also gives a hint of what we're mainly doing here: programming.<br>
As we were not the only ones working in a robotic internship, here is a <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/projects_list+sid=22">list of all current robotic-projects</a> at the <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/home">Robotics Lab</a>.<br>
Our project was supervised by Gero Plettenberg and Thomas Kloepfer.<BR>Thank you guys, for your help!

The resources & components
</h2>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
As we planed to take the super-fancy robot home with us after finishing it, it was necessary to buy all the components by ourselves (the other groups got them payed by the robotics lab). Right from the beginning we tried to keep costs as low as possible (you know, as we're students, we always run out of money.... =/ ) - of course this resulted in a little loss of quality.
<BR>
Programming tecniques, information about how to build a POV-globe were either our personal knowledge or open-source from the internet.
<br>
Finally we had a great benefit of using the working-room of the robotics-lab, equipped with computers, internet and a lot of hardware-stuff (cables, connectors, electronic components, wood, metal, screws, ...); thanks IWR!. Also any tools needed, such as screw-drivers, drilling machines, saws, soldering irons, voltage and ampere meters, voltage suppliers and many more things, could be found and used there.<br>
<br>
Besides some cables, switches, diodes, resistors, connectors and screws, the components we are using, are

<ul>



<li> a mini computer <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi Model B+</a> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/raspi1.jpg" target="_blank">image1</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/raspi2.jpg" target="_blank">image2</a>)

<li> a 4GB micro SD-card (anyone like <a href="http://www.kingston.com/de/flash/microsd_cards#">these</a>)<br>[Note: I suggest picking a bigger one than 4GB, we had some problems with the space during our work. 8GB is already fine.]

<li> a simple <a href="http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/?categoryid=3958&model=TL-WN823N">wireless-adapter</a> from <a href="http://www.tp-link.us/">TP-Link</a> for remote-ssh-control (AP-mode)<br>[Note: this model is actually not the best choice to work with on a Raspi] (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/wlan.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>) and

<li> a self-made 7V to 5V voltage-regulator (which seems to work fine with 9.6V, too) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/voltage_regulator.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>)

</ul>
