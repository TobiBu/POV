This summer term we have completed an interesting internship at our university: We're constructing a persitence of vision globe. <br>
The internship started in June 2015 already and lasted until the October 2015.

The university
</h2>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
The internship takes place at the <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/">University of Heidelberg</a>, located in a small, but famous and beautiful town in the south of Germany. The university can proudly call itself the oldest one in Germany.<br>
Altough all of us are studying physics, the project is part of the <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/">IWR (interdisciplinary research center for scientific computing)</a> at the <a href="http://www.mathinf.uni-heidelberg.de/">Informatics Faculty</a>, which illustrates the flexibility in our studies and also gives a hint of what we're mainly doing here: programming.<br>
As we are not the only ones working in a robotic internship, here is a <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/projects_list+sid=21">list of all current robotic-projects</a> at the <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/home">Robotics Lab</a>.<br>
Our project is supervised by Gero Plettenberg and Thomas Kloepfer Thank you guys, for your help!

The resources & components
</h2>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
Except our knowledge, the ressources we are using are either provided by the informatics faculty (thanks, guys ;) ) or are open-source (source-code & information from the internet).<br>
As there are <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/projects_list+sid=21">many other groups</a> working on different robotic-projects at the IWR, there is a small room available to all internship-students at the university, equipped with computers, internet and a lot of hardware-stuff (cables, connectors, electronic components, wood, metal, screws, ...). Also any tools needed, such as screw-drivers, drilling machines, saws, soldering irons, voltage and ampere meters, voltage suppliers and many more things, can be found and used there.<br>
<br>
Besides some cables, switches, diodes, connectors, screws and plexiglas, the components we are using, are
</p>


<ul>



<li> a mini computer <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi Model B+</a> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/raspi1.jpg" target="_blank">image1</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/raspi2.jpg" target="_blank">image2</a>)

<li> a 4GB micro SD-card (anyone like <a href="http://www.kingston.com/de/flash/microsd_cards#">these</a>)<br>[Note: I suggest picking a bigger one than 4GB, we had some problems with the space during our work. 8GB is already fine.]

<li> a simple <a href="http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/?categoryid=3958&model=TL-WN823N">wireless-adapter</a> from <a href="http://www.tp-link.us/">TP-Link</a> for remote-ssh-control (AP-mode)<br>[Note: this model is actually not the best choice to work with on a Raspi] (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/wlan.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>) and

<li> a self-made 7V to 5V voltage-regulator (which seems to work fine with 9.6V, too) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/voltage_regulator.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>)

</ul>
