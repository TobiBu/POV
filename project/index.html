This summer term we have completed an interesting internship at our university: We've constructed a persitence of vision globe. <br>
The internship started in June 2015 already and lasted until the October 2015.

The university
</h2>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
The internship took place at the <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/">University of Heidelberg</a>, located in a small, but famous and beautiful town in the south of Germany. The university can proudly call itself the oldest one in Germany.<br>
Altough all of us are studying physics, the project is part of the <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/">IWR (interdisciplinary research center for scientific computing)</a> at the <a href="http://www.mathinf.uni-heidelberg.de/">Informatics Faculty</a>, which illustrates the flexibility in our studies and also gives a hint of what we're mainly doing here: programming.<br>
As we were not the only ones working in a robotic internship, here is a <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/projects_list+sid=22">list of all current robotic-projects</a> at the <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/home">Robotics Lab</a>.<br>
Our project was supervised by Gero Plettenberg and Thomas Kloepfer.<BR>Thank you guys, for your help!

The resources & components
</h2>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
As we planed to take the super-fancy robot home with us after finishing it, it was necessary to buy all the components by ourselves (the other groups got them payed by the robotics lab). Right from the beginning we tried to keep costs as low as possible (you know, as we're students, we always run out of money.... =/ ) - of course this resulted in a little loss of quality.
<BR>
The Programming tecniques and the information about how to build a POV-globe were either our personal knowledge or open-source from the internet.
<br>
Finally we had a great benefit of using the working-room of the robotics-lab, equipped with computers, internet and a lot of hardware-stuff (cables, connectors, electronic components, wood, metal, screws and many other things); thanks IWR! Also any tools needed, such as screw-drivers, drilling machines, saws, soldering irons, voltage and ampere meters, voltage suppliers and many more things, could be found and used there.<br>
<br>
Besides some cables, switches, diodes, resistors, connectors and screws, the components we were using, are
</p>


<ul>

<li> a mini computer <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi Model B+</a> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/raspi1.jpg" target="_blank">image1</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/raspi2.jpg" target="_blank">image2</a>),

<li> a 4GB micro SD-card (anyone like <a href="http://www.kingston.com/de/flash/microsd_cards#">these</a>)<br>(Note: I suggest picking a bigger one than 4GB, we had some problems with the space during our work. 8GB is already fine.),

<li> a simple <a href="http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/?categoryid=3958&model=TL-WN823N">wireless-adapter</a> from <a href="http://www.tp-link.us/">TP-Link</a> for remote-ssh-control (AP-mode)<br>[Note: this model is actually not the best choice to work with on a Raspi] (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/wlan.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>),

<li> a <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/2239">DotStar</a> LED strip from Adafruit. 60 separately addressable LEDs on a 1m-strip. Easily addressable via 4-PINS (5Volts, Ground, Data and Clock). High refreshing frequency, thus suitable for POV. (NOTE: NeoPixels is too slow, for example!),

<li> an infrared LED on the rotating body & a photodiode on the not-rotating part for thus measuring the rotating-frequency,

<li> a 4-PIN jack-plug like <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jack.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a> for transmitting the signal onto the rotating body,

<li> a motor of an old room-fan like <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fan.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a> for rotating the LEDs. We located it beneath the wooden slab. The advantage of this one is: It already comes with a common 230V-power supply-plug.

<li> the rotating construction, consisting of a aluminium rod (axis of the rotating system), two ball bearings and a circular grate holding the LED strip (we used a simple <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/grate.jpg" target="_blank">barbecue-cooking</a> grate here ;) ),

<li> a toothed belt and two (self-made) gear-wheels to bring the rotation onto the grate and

<li> a big wooden slab and some aluminium rods to support the construction and minimize shakings from the rotations.

</ul>
