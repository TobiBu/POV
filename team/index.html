<p class="fancy"> Hi, </p>

<p class="fancy" align="justify"> 
tinkering with LEDs is something really fun to do. Because I really like doing <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">handicraft work</a> I thought this project would be perfect to learn a lot and have fun doing it. The robotics labs taught me, that with some imagination and work we can nowadays build all kinds of cool things. My next project will be a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Persistence-of-Vision-Wand/">POV wand</a>

For my thesis I work at the MPI for nuclear physics in the division <a href="http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/pfeifer/interatto-group/">Quantum Dynamics & Control</a>. In our group we do time-resolved spectroscopy in the femtosecond domain. My job has to do with the characterization of the pulses in the time domain. Thanks to the knowledge I gained about GPIO pins and servo motors I was able to construct automated laser shutters for my workgroup.

During my freetime I like reading fantasy books, <a href="http://www.chilloutzone.net/">watching stupid videos</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">movie trailers</a> and spending time with my girlfriend. YES, exactly in this order :)
