POV GLOBE
============

This Repository includes the documentation and python code for our POV Globe made out of a Adafruit DotStar LED strip.
The code is based on a modified version of the function for reading .png pictures and displaying them on the globe included in the Adafruit examples.

POV (Persistence of Vision) creates the illusion of moving objects by the use of a sequence of changing images with a frequency of at least 24 Hz.
We used this effect to create a globe (consisting of LEDs on a rotating circle) on which we can address each LED on the globe's surface separately.

In this github-repository you will find the code (Python, used with a Rasperry Pi B+) and some documentation. More information can be found on our website [POV Globe](https://TobiBu.github.io/POV) (made with Jekyll).
